# LineScapes
This project showcases the creation of a generative NFT art collection using Python libraries Pillow (PIL) and the ChatGPT 3.0 API. Each NFT is named based on its color and attributes using ChatGPT 3.0, and the collection is deployed onto the Ethereum Level 2 chain Polygon using an ERC-721 contract.
